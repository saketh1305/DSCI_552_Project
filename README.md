# DSCI_552_PROJECT
## MACHINE LEARNING FOR DATASCIENCE
### CATEGORY AND LANDMARK CLASSIFICATION USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS AND TRANSFER LEARNING
The project aims to develop a model to predict categories and landmarks for a given image.
The dataset consists of images of famous landmarks, organized into six categories and 30
landmarks. Several models were trained with varying degrees of augmentation and transfer
learning, and their performance was evaluated on both the training and test data. The results
show that using transfer learning and data augmentation can significantly improve the model's
performance on the test set. Hyperparameter tuning and selecting the right pre-trained model
can also affect the results.
